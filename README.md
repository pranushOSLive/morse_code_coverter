# morse_code_coverter
Python code to convert morse code only alphabets (Numbers and other symbols not included for now)
This is normal alogorithm just forward and backward no special.
Working on a research to find most efficent and advanced morse_code decoder when the morse code doesn't have spaces in them.
When a morse code doesn't have spaces in them then there is chances of getting atleast 4 different variables or letters for single word.
And for sentences and pages it took days to decode morse code if it doesn't have spaces(Manually).
